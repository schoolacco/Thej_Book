## Research Existing UIs

|UI Name|Plus|Minus|Implication|
|-|-|-|-|
|Google Classroom|It isn't congested with too many buttons and/or frames with extra options that aren't nessecarily always required being collapsible to allow focus upon the main content of the UI (Assignments, Announcements, etc.). It is also engineered for convenience giving potentially useful reminders about upcoming assignments and gives quick links for teachers who want to use more off-platform programs instead. Along with the ability to hid unused, unarchived classes and many other features which allow for the simplification of the UI.|The most notable issue with the Google Classroom UI is the outright lack of an easily accessible dark mode with a dark mode solely existing for the mobile app and not the (arguably more commonly used) website, instead you'd have to download a chrome extension to do so which is often not even possible due to the Department of Education preventing school accounts from downloading chrome extensions. Other then that any issues are very minor.|The Google Classroom UI is an incerdibly good example of such (as you'd expect from a multi-billion dollar company), It would be a good idea to replicate it's overall capability of optional minimisation of anything that may distract from the main content of the UI, however importantly it must not replicate it's mistake and actually have a dark mode for users who view the site under a harsh lighting.|
|Ublock₀ Dashboard|The Ublock₀ Dashboard is very simplistic and straight to the point looking like something that could easily be made with tkinter. It contains simple checkboxes along with some options menus and entry points across several tabs however it majorly lacks aesthetically and does not explain many of the more particular features instead linking to a different website instead. It's easy to navigate but difficult to fully understand.|As mentioned in the 'Plus' section it severely lacks aesthetically looking like as if it was made with tkinter with little to no actual customization, it also puts absolutely no effort in explaining what so many buttons do, even if the navigation is intuitive it's almost useless without any explanation of what the user is actually doing, and it lacks a dark mode.|There is a lot to improve upon, most notably it requires massive aesthetic upgrades as it completely lacks any attempt at it, and it isn't entirely accessible and still lacks a dark mode, however it is a useful scaffold for what I could design via tkinter and it's navigation is rather intuitive and easily replicable.|
|Gosford High School Gitbook|The Gosford High School Gitbook has a reasonable UI, it is indeed easy to navigate and most tabs fall under one category preventing potential clutter, there is some degree of aesthetics however some pages are just walls of text, the year 10 sections is aesthetically much worse than the year 9 section.|To begin simply the aesthetics are simply inconsistent across the website, some categories will have an image in every tab whilst others will lack any altogether, especially in the year 10 section, it also suffers from a lack of a dark mode.|It's navigation system can be replicated but mistakes such as inconsistent aesthetics and the lack of a dark mode can be fixed to overall better the final UI|
