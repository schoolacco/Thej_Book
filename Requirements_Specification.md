## Functional Requirements

### Purpose

The application will allow for more amateur readers to begin to have some level of comprehension of what the book is, allowing them to properly understand the story and more importantly the general meaning behind it as Dante's Inferno (like many complex books) has much more below its apparent surface.

### Use Cases

---

Interactions:

1. The user will be capable of accessing each layer of Hell including the details of it. The journey would begin from the homescreen, before clicking a specified button to bring them to the desired layer.
2. The user will be capable of seeing more context of famous characters (notably those from the Greek Mythos) which appear in Dante's Inferno (likely damned to Hell). This will begin with the home page before the user goes to the specified layer of hell, from there there will be an image of the character and the capability to click on it for more context.
3. The user will be capable of taking a quick quiz for each character, using information within the text and possibly from their original source. This would be done by going from the home page to the layer of hell to the extra character description, from there, there will be an option for a quiz.
4. The user will be incapable of accessing the further sub-sections dedicated to the rest of the 'Commedia' (Those sections being 'Purgatorio' and 'Paradiso' [Purgatory and Paradise/Heaven]). Upon reaching the bottom of Hell the user will see an option to ascend to the rest of the afterlife... and have their default web browser open to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

### (Planned) Test Cases

---

1. When the user clicks a button (or scrolls far down enough) it will send them to the next layer of Hell (or in the case of scrolling, the next layer)
2. When the user clicks on the image of a character it will open up a sub-window giving further detail on who the character actually is and why they are there.
3. When the user clicks on the quiz section of the priorly mentioned sub-window (see previous test case) they will be prompted with an option to start quiz, after which it will begin.
4. When quickly scrolling up from the bottom of Hell to the top (or when clicking the button) they will be sent to the priorly mentioned video (see 4th use case) instead of the other sections of the 'Commedia'.
