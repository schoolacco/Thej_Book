# Evaluations

## Feedback evaluations

### UX

Overall the 2nd design was preferred, the others were both considered too spacious although the first design was considered easily navigatable by most, I will likely however end up using the 3rd design simply due to the fact that it is overall more original, and it is more reasonably possible within the limitations of tkinter.

### Proto_1

It was overall a success, with a simple yet effective design, although it was considered rather limited, which was expected. Once more the 2nd design would've been preferable but managing to use .place() with tkinter.ttk frames is incredibly difficult, and .place() in itself is an incredibly tedious function to use.

### Proto_2

Not much has changed, other than the simplification as to allow for an easy way to make the many layers, there were some complaints relating to the background of the small quiz not matching that of the main window, which is simply a minor oversight which will be fixed in a subsequent update.

## FINAL EVALUATION

1. The program succeeds yet fails in meeting many of functional and non-functional requirements, for example it does successfully have a quiz, and it includes information of characters, but the further detail is not included due to time constraints and the minor joke is also not included, the non-functional requirements were all met, although security was only met due to the lack of anything requiring it, as for the original purpose it still remains unclear whether or not it has achieved that goal. However other than the lack of detail everything works as intended.

2. It is unclear how well it meets the purpose in the design brief, as the program contains information that is reasonably understandable, but it lacks the nessecary detail for a true understanding of the book, inevitably it is relatively suitable to the target audience but it does not entirely fufil its purpose.

3. The project addresses the relevant social, ethical and legal responsibilities rather well, the book itself is old enough to have lost copyright, hence not making it an issue, the user experience however does use potentially copyrighted material (although most of it is from the wikipedia page(s) which I believe falls under the Wikimedia commons), and social/ethical issues still remain due to the contents of the book itself, with some arguably being offensive to those not of the christian faith, but the project has managed this relatively well by ensuring no explicit reference to non-christian figures.

4. Terribly, although it was mostly due to the major limitations of tkinter essentially giving me a migrane, tkinter's .pack() and .place() are not compatible, even if that .place() is within a frame which just happens to be using .pack(), which left me stuck for weeks with no idea on how to fix the issue with the frame not scrolling all due to this singular issue, using .pack() also allowed me to create a function to simplify the entire process into one function, the other major issue was actually writing down all the information in the book and simplifying it all, and downloading all the image, etc. It is tiring and demotivating and led to rather inconsistent progress at best.

5. User feedback and testing could only be responded to by so much, the countless limitations of tkinter create several issues with what is preferable versus what is reasonably possible, hence often feedback was ignored due to the inability to meet such. There is one major aspect of the project that needs improvement, the content, currently the content is rather brief and that is solely the fault of a lack of time due to the priorly mentioned time wasted to tkinter's limits, if there were a future to this project, it is the main thing that must be improved.
