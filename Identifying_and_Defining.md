## Functional Requirements

---

---

### Purpose

The application will allow for more amateur readers to begin to have some level of comprehension of what the book is, allowing them to properly understand the story and more importantly the general meaning behind it as Dante's Inferno (like many complex books) has much more below its apparent surface.

### Use Cases

---

Interactions:

1. The user will be capable of accessing each layer of Hell including the details of it. The journey would begin from the homescreen, before clicking a specified button to bring them to the desired layer.
2. The user will be capable of seeing more context of famous characters (notably those from the Greek Mythos) which appear in Dante's Inferno (likely damned to Hell). This will begin with the home page before the user goes to the specified layer of hell, from there there will be an image of the character and the capability to click on it for more context.
3. The user will be capable of taking a quick quiz for each character, using information within the text and possibly from their original source. This would be done by going from the home page to the layer of hell to the extra character description, from there, there will be an option for a quiz.
4. The user will be incapable of accessing the further sub-sections dedicated to the rest of the 'Commedia' (Those sections being 'Purgatorio' and 'Paradiso' [Purgatory and Paradise/Heaven]). Upon reaching the bottom of Hell the user will see an option to ascend to the rest of the afterlife... and have their default web browser open to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

---

### (Planned) Test Cases

---

1. When the user clicks a button (or scrolls far down enough) it will send them to the next layer of Hell (or in the case of scrolling, the next layer)
2. When the user clicks on the image of a character it will open up a sub-window giving further detail on who the character actually is and why they are there.
3. When the user clicks on the quiz section of the priorly mentioned sub-window (see previous test case) they will be prompted with an option to start quiz, after which it will begin.
4. When quickly scrolling up from the bottom of Hell to the top (or when clicking the button) they will be sent to the priorly mentioned video (see 4th use case) instead of the other sections of the 'Commedia'.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

---

---

### Performance

---

1. All priorly mentioned interactions will take place in under a second (unless accessing an online source for any reason)
2. The program will not crash having error handling to prevent such.
3. There should be little to no visible delay in user input.

---

### Usability

---

1. The program will have a relatively consistent layout throughout.
2. The program's font size will be relatively large to cater for those who suffer from poor eyesight.
3. The program will not break from having a too large screen size.

---

### Reliability

---

1. It will be tested across multiple devices with varying screen sizes to ensure that it functions as intended.
2. It will be tested by me to see if I can reasonably read the text.
3. It will be ensured to have a reasonably consistent layout throughout.

---

### Security

---

1. User feedback forms will not require any personal information
2. The system will not have an account system.

---

## Social, Ethical and Legal Issues

---
---

### Social Impact

---

Considering what the book is there will likely be some notable social issues with it. The target audience are those who lack the level of literacy to properly understand the book, there are many possible reasons for this, hence, some must be accounted for such as poor eyesight, and lack of attention span (joke). Hence some decision (or special options) will be made for those. Such a site has many theoritical possible benefits including fostering (or possibly creating) a love for reading and the general deeper meanings behind these more complex stories, many are drawn away from classics solely due to the "unhappy ending" (boohoo), a key thing is to understand that the story doesn't need to always be happy, that understanding it what allows a reader to truly appreciate the more complex books like Inferno. Of course there is the rather obvious religious issue with the depiction of Hell and what not. However I would argue that Hell doesn't actually exist in the Bible hence it isn't a religious issue, besides if you're getting offended by fictional theology you really lack anything better to do in life.

---

### Ethical Responsibilities

---

The prototype will not collect any user data except for possible feedback, hence there is not much concern for responsible handling of such data unless the idiot of a user decides to insert personal information into the feedback (seriously?). In terms of representation and inclusion, there is not much to be done, the book was written long before such concepts were popularised and became mainstream, hence I waver any responsibility for a lack of representation and inclusion or any old stereotypes portrayed in the 'Commedia', but context will be given when nessecary to hopefully lower the possible offence. As for content senstivity, it is **Inferno**... it depicts hell, the user will be given a ***CLEAR*** warning about the disturbing content of the book upon first running the program, I waver any responsibility for the naming of such disturbing topics, there is a warning, listen to it.

---

### Copyright & Intellectual Property

---

Now this is the real issue. Although Inferno itself is far too old to have an copyright the english translation and the general Penguins Classics introduction-that-explains-everything is copyrighted, however under the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth.) [Source - NESA] I am allowed to use 10% (or 1 chapter) of copyrighted material (with due credit) hence I am legally allowed to quote the book, but most of it will be paraphrasing or somewhat original work of mine. As for images, yes I will use online images (as I lack any level of artistic talent without the python turle module) and they will be given due credit when due. If possible I will attempt to use images under the creative commons (giving credit as needed as per usual).
